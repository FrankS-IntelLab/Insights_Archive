Rev 0.0.1 Initial idea

Many years ago I was at business department serving as a planner kind of role, and gradually I was introduced into digitization projects as business analyst, data analyst, etc.,
Normally in a digitization project the role I bore before was called as SME or simply, the business. 
They(I) are deemed as one step closer to the business front line than others in the digitization project, and normally requirements for the development were also from them(Me), the business.




When I was in the business department, I never refused to use programming languages to do my business analysis and use suitable approaches to get a decision(techniques used in e.g.,  finance analysis, statistics, operational research, etc.,), even though some people may think business people should only embrace excel and powerpoint. I guess the experience or the tendency in choosing tools might be one of the reasons that I am capable of handling both roles as the picture defined in the post, Data Analyst and Business Analyst. 

However my experience tells me, the two roles could have been one role, or if Data Analyst and Business Analyst has to be differentiated into two roles due to some reasons, at least there should be a new pillar for the role that bears the best mix of the two roles, and give it a dedicated seat, as that would bring much more value than silo them.

And if you don’t recognize it seriously, it wouldn’t be there, and your org may lost the interest it could have earned with the insights generated by that role, because demand drive supply, if something was never recognized or defined properly, then there is no base measure its value not to mention realizing its value

Apart from that, whether the role is equipped with the right toolkit or not also matters, at least it should include:
Cloud based Jupyter Notebook-like computing environment
Cloud based storage place that has connection to corporate internal data(assuming the readers of this article is hired by a coporation), and also allow them to upload data to test novel ideas

And, please be aware of one fact, this role is targeting at problem solving, business value realization, risk detection and mitigation etc., , without highlighting it I am worried that people would tend to perceive them wrong because they use techniques that nowadays people think only software developers knows how to run(sarcastically given the fact that almost everyone knows python is easy to use and easy to learn, sometimes people would still consider you are a developer simply because you know how to code in python, however HR wouldn’t hire a developer if the developer only know how to run python pandas, without knowing other things e.g., Git, CICD)

Some key takeaways to conclude this short article
A dedicated role that bear the best mix of the Data Analyst and Business Analyst deserves a seat
Corporate should equip them with the right toolkit if the corporate don’t want to lose revenue they could have earned
Jupyter Notebook and Python is a great set of tools to analyze business problems with data(Just cite them as example, I didn’t mean they are the only set that is good), they were supposed to be the excel in the decade, I know there are many practitioners doing it in this way already, maybe much earlier than I did, but obviously the public awareness could have been better than this
